//! Bitset view of cards and the owner of the card-play rule.
//!
//! `play_levels` (which cards may be played) and `takes` / `trick_winner` (who wins a trick)
//! are the single implementation of these rules: `cards::allowed_cards`, `Game` and
//! `engine::fast` all call them. The test `play_levels_mirror_allowed_cards` keeps the former
//! `Vec`-based implementation as a reference oracle on random tricks and hands.
